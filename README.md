# Dodge Dash — King of Newport Nightlife (10 Levels)

This package ships **without** the MP3 to keep the repo size small. The game expects a file named **`niiko_x_swae.mp3`** in the same folder as `index.html`.

## Files
- `index.html` — the full 10-level game
- *(you add)* `niiko_x_swae.mp3` — place it next to `index.html`

## Publish on GitHub Pages
1. Create a **public** repo (e.g. `dodge-dash-newport`).
2. Upload `index.html` **and** your `niiko_x_swae.mp3` to the **repo root**.
3. Go to **Settings → Pages** and set:
   - **Branch:** `main`
   - **Folder:** `/ (root)`
4. Click **Save** and wait ~1 minute.
5. Your game will be live at: `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-REPO/`

## Controls
- **Desktop:** Arrows or WASD (smooth movement).
- **Mobile:** Tilt left/right **and** forward/back (allow motion permissions). Tap left/right as fallback.
- Press **Play** to start. 30s per level. **1 hit = Game Over** (restart from Level 1).

## Power-ups
